# GPORTAL Cloud CLI

A handy little commandline tool to access the GPORTAL Cloud API.


## Install and update

On first run, it asks for credentials (client-id, client-secret, username and
password) and saves them in a config file or the system keyring. To update
the CLI, just run the ```selfupdate``` command. It will download the latest release
from GitHub and replace the current binary.


## Development

All files which ends with ```_gen.go``` are autogenerated and should not be
edited manually. To regenerate them, run ```go generate```. If you want to
add a new subcommand, see ```pkg/generator/definition/``` for some examples.
Generated code files are NOT checked in, because the user can always generate
them himself. This is done to avoid merge conflicts.


You can always add custom subcommands without generating it. Just add a new
file to ```cmd/```. The file name will be the name of the subcommand.


## TODO after release
* Check selfupdate
* Fix interactive command
* Write a comprehensive README for developers

### Nice to haves

* Migrate code generation to Jennifer
* Pagination support for long lists (pending because of Jennifer migration)
* Separate admin and non admin commands (or check if the user is an admin?)
