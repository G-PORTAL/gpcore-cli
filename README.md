# GPCloud CLI

Just run `go run gpc.go` to see the help menu.
On first run, it asks for credentials (client-id, client-secret) and saves them
in a config file. To create a new oauth client for the credentials, go to
https://panel.g-portal.cloud/user/settings/clients. The default config path is
located at `~/.gpc.yaml`.

## Basic usage
First you can list the projects you have access to:
```
$ go run gpc.go project list
```

Then you can select the project you want to work with:
```
$ go run gpc.go project use --id <project-id>
```

After a project was chosen, you can use the nodes commands:
```
$ go run gpc.go node list
```

## Development

All files which ends with ```_gen.go``` are autogenerated and should not be
edited manually. To regenerate them, run ```go generate```. If you want to
add a new subcommand, see ```pkg/generator/definition/``` for some examples.
Generated code files are also checked in, so there are part of the repository.

You can always add custom subcommands without generating it. Just add a new
file to ```cmd/```. The file name will be the name of the subcommand.

# TODOs

* Format output for console usage (table formatter?)
* Add hooks to subcommands (pre/post)
* Add mandatory params (in addition to optional ones)
* Gitlab build pipeline
* Auto-Update command to update to tool itself
* Pagination support for long lists
